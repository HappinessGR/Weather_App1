A simple Python weather app that fetches live weather data from the SheCodes Weather API. Built with Requests and DateTime, it displays the current temperature and condition .


Your Final Project: Weather Forecast App
What does your app do?

My app allows users to enter the name of a city and get the current weather conditions. It connects to the SheCodes Weather API and displays information such as temperature, description of the weather (e.g., “clear sky”), and the date/time.

What features will it include?

User can input any city.

Shows temperature, weather condition, and an icon link.

Displays the current date and time.

Handles errors (e.g., invalid city name, network issues, timeout).

Lets the user repeatedly check multiple cities until they type exit.

Which concepts will you apply?

Functions (get_weather) to keep the code organized.

Modules: requests for API calls and datetime for showing the current date/time.

Error handling with try/except to manage API errors and invalid input.

Loops to allow multiple searches.

Conditionals to validate responses and handle edge cases.
